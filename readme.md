# SAM4S Emulator

This is a script I'm using when working with the SAM4S SDK/printer. It accepts TCP connections and can receive images that the SDK is printing out, thus allowing me to work without a physical printer.

There is no support for printing anything other than images.

There is no support for being discovered by the SDKs "find printers" function.
